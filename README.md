## 9. Data Model

All 12 tables are implemented in `backend/src/features/*/models.py` and managed via Alembic migrations.

```
admin_users       (id, neon_auth_user_id, email, role: owner|operative, is_active)

products          (id, line: polo_atelier|signature|essential, name, description, is_active)

product_variants  (id, product_id, style: classic|design, size, color, sku, barcode,
                   stock_qty, cost_acquisition_usd, price_usd, is_active)

product_images    (id, variant_id, url, position, alt_text)

saved_addresses   (id, neon_auth_user_id, label, full_name, line1, line2, city, state,
                   zip, country, phone, is_default)

orders            (id, neon_auth_user_id [nullable=guest], customer_email, status,
                   payment_status, subtotal_usd, shipping_usd, discount_usd, total_usd,
                   shipping_address [JSONB], is_free_shipping, stripe_payment_intent_id,
                   carrier_tracking_number, envia_shipment_id, envia_label_url,
                   discount_code_id)

order_items       (id, order_id, variant_id, qty, unit_price_usd)

discount_codes    (id, code, type: percent|fixed, value [percent max 100],
                   usage_limit, usage_count, expires_at, is_active)

exchanges         (id, order_id, original_variant_id, replacement_variant_id [nullable],
                   status: requested|approved|shipped|completed|rejected,
                   customer_notes, admin_notes)

purchase_orders   (id, reference_number, supplier_name, expected_arrival_date,
                   status: ordered|in_transit|received, created_by_user_id)

purchase_order_items (id, po_id, variant_id, qty_ordered, qty_received)

operating_costs   (id, label, amount_usd, is_recurring, notes)
```

**Key DB constraints:**
- `product_variants.price_usd > 0`, `stock_qty >= 0`, `cost_acquisition_usd >= 0`
- `order_items.qty > 0`
- `discount_codes.value > 0`, percent discounts `value <= 100`
- `purchase_order_items.qty_ordered > 0`, `qty_received >= 0`
- One default saved address per user (partial unique index)

---

## 10. Business Logic & Policies

### Shipping
- Real-time rate from envia.com API using fixed dimensions 33×26×10 cm
- Free shipping automatically applied when total `qty >= 5` across all order items
- International shipping supported (envia.com covers cross-border from Mexico)

### Pricing & Margins
- All prices stored and displayed in USD (`decimal.Decimal`, not float)
- Margin formula: `(sale_price − cost_acquisition − sum(operating_costs)) / sale_price ≥ 0.50`
- Discount codes validated server-side; rejected if margin floor breached
- Financial dashboard shows: revenue, COGS, operating costs, net profit, margin %

### Exchanges (no returns)
- Customer initiates via account portal or contact form
- Same product line/category only (enforced in service layer)
- Admin logs exchange in system; shipping cost covered by Vantier
- Resend triggers notification emails to both parties

### Barcodes / SKUs
- Auto-generated on variant creation: format `VAT-{LINE}-{STYLE}-{SIZE}-{COLOR}-{SUFFIX}`
- Suffix is a 4-character hex token (UUID-based) — collision-safe, no race conditions
- Printable as PDF barcode label from admin panel

### Authentication
- All JWT tokens issued and verified via **Neon Auth** (JWKS endpoint)
- Admin roles (`owner`, `operative`) stored in `admin_users` table, keyed by Neon Auth user ID
- Storefront customers authenticated via Neon Auth; their user IDs stored as strings on orders/addresses (no FK — customers are not in `admin_users`)
- Guest checkout supported (`neon_auth_user_id` nullable on orders)

---

## 11. Development Roadmap

### Phase 1 — Foundation ✅ COMPLETE

**Backend infrastructure (100% done):**
- [x] Project scaffolding: FastAPI + Neon PostgreSQL + pyenv virtualenv (`vantier-backend`, Python 3.12.7)
- [x] Neon Auth JWT middleware (`src/core/auth.py`) — JWKS-based RS256 verification
- [x] Async SQLAlchemy 2.0 engine + session factory (`src/core/database.py`)
- [x] Pydantic v2 settings from `.env` (`src/core/config.py`)
- [x] RBAC dependencies: `get_current_user`, `get_admin_user`, `require_owner` (`src/core/dependencies.py`)
- [x] Structured exception hierarchy with FastAPI handlers (`src/core/exceptions.py`)
- [x] SKU/barcode generation, pagination utilities (`src/core/utils.py`)
- [x] FastAPI app factory with lifespan, CORS, health endpoint (`src/main.py`)
- [x] Vertical Slice Architecture folder structure (`src/features/`, `src/integrations/`)
- [x] All 12 ORM models across 7 feature slices
- [x] Alembic baseline migration (`001`) — 9 enums, 12 tables, all FK/check constraints, indexes
- [x] Second migration (`002`) — percent discount constraint + partial unique index on default address
- [x] `CLAUDE.md` with environment and architecture instructions

**What's still needed before Phase 2 can start:**
- [ ] `.env` file populated with real Neon DB URL, Neon Auth JWKS URL, and audience
- [ ] `alembic upgrade head` run against the Neon database to apply migrations
- [ ] USD pricing confirmed for all product lines (required for checkout)
